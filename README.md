## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Apologies to my future self for turnaround time delays.
Eventually got to use CSS Grid for first time on frontendmentor.io as differentiated from FlexBox.
Most say it's a very powerful tool, and it excites me.


### Continued development

Another media query actually due between mobile and full desktop view but I'm tired much.
So subsequently will explore and practice best responsive CSS Grid use.

### Useful resources

Stackoverflow, MDN Web Docs, Google
